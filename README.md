Analyzing Congressional Stock Trading and Voting Patterns Using Network Science

## Overview

CongressTradeNet is a network science project that investigates potential conflicts of interest in the U.S. Congress by analyzing relationships between lawmakers' stock transactions, their voting behavior, and legislative activities. By leveraging publicly available data on Senate and House votes, stock disclosures, and vote rationales, this project constructs a network model to identify patterns that may suggest insider trading or ethical concerns.

This project is exploratory and aims to contribute to the public discourse on congressional transparency and ethics, particularly in light of legislative efforts like the ETHICS Act (2024) to restrict stock trading by lawmakers. Note: Findings are not conclusive evidence of illegal activity but highlight areas for further investigation.

## Objectives

- Map relationships between lawmakers, stock trades, votes, and legislation using network science.
- Identify unusual patterns, such as trades in industries affected by bills shortly before or after votes.
- Provide an open-source framework for researchers and policymakers to study congressional behavior.
